# My EGR186 Final Project
Last year for my Intro to Engineering class, my group of 3 had to find a problem involving sustainability, and then create a solution to that problem.
While we discussed many problems, we decided on the problem being the amount of car batteries in which are thrown away each year.  We wanted to find a way to reduce the amount of batteries thrown away with a sustainable solution.

Wanting it to be something the average person could purchase, we found many solutions but in the end shaved it down to three.
The first possible solution was an attachable solar panel.  Somehow, this would charge a battery throughout the day.  While this wouldn't fully charge it, the battery would last longer and thus reduce the amount of batterys thrown away.
The second was a little more vague in the solution.  It would be a charging station, similar to Tesla charging stations, but for just the battery of the car.
The last was a sort of charging box which used solar panels.  Leave this box outside, it would gain power through the panels.  Then once you get home, hook it to your battery, charge it up and repeat.
